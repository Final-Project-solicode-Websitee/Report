# Section 1: Methodology

This section outlines the technical approach and tools used in the development of the Goals App.

## Technical Stack

The project leverages a modern web stack to ensure scalability and maintainability:

- **Backend**: Laravel Framework (PHP)
- **Frontend**: Alpine.js, Tailwind CSS, Preline UI
- **Documentation**: Markdown (Pandoc compatible)

## Architecture Patterns

We have implemented several key patterns:

1. **Base Component Pattern**: Centralizing common Alpine.js logic.
2. **Service Layer**: Decoupling business logic from controllers.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Ensuring secure access to administrative features.
